Hi, there! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Rochester. My advisor is [Prof. Hangfeng He](https://hornhehhf.github.io/). Before joining Prof. He's lab, I got my bachelor degree of Automation at South China University of Technology. 

My current research interests lie in aligning large language models with human values. Currently, I focus on developing robust evaluation methods for text generation tasks, such as summarization. Previously, I am also interested in efficient ML and hardware-software Codesign. 

I am open to all kinds of collaborations, feel free to contact me.
