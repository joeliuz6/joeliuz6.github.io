Hi, there! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Rochester. My advisor is [Prof. Hangfeng He](https://hornhehhf.github.io/). Before joining Prof. He's lab, I got my bachelor degree of Automation at South China University of Technology. 

My current research interests center on exploring data utilization in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, I focus on developing innovative methods to extract new knowledge from data through LLMs, with the goal of enhancing downstream tasks. I am also deeply interested in efficient machine learning and hardware-software co-design.

I welcome collaborations of all kinds—feel free to reach out to me at [zhuo.liu@rochester.edu].
