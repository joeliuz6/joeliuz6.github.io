# Introduction: What's fairness? 
The concept "fairness" was first proposed in about late 2000s, attracting a wide interest together with ethical AI in the last decade. In general, fairness can be divided into three categories: group fairness, individual fairness and conterfactual fairness, where the former two are statistical dependence measures and the latter is rooted in causal inference. So how do we define fairness? 
## Values of fairness in real-world applications 
## Fairness-Accuracy tradeoff 

# Regularization and inference with label constraints 
- Regularization with label constraints 
- On-training approach: Inference-based training 
- Learning plus inference 

# Achieve flexible fairness-accuracy tradeoff at test time 
## Learning with constraints
- YOTO
- YODO 
## Inference with constraints
